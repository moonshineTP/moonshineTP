I'm **Hung Pham**, a nonchalant coder with no significant coding achievements as of now. I'm invested in Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm 20 now and currently a third year student of Hanoi University of Science and Technology. The last two years of university have been packed with knowledge and buried in deadlines, as it feels like I’ve suffered for an entire decade. My head was for long a mess of parallelized thoughts and emotion disorders, and I am on the way to heal and identify myself. For now, I'm full of energy and positivity. I was assured that my vision was sufficient, so I will head down the mountain to seek an internship. My ambition is to become a competent **decision-maker**, or at least able to support other's decision-making process.

I have solid and deep knowledge in:
- Olympiad/Undergrad Mathematics
- Applied Algorithm, Data Structures and Databases.
- Optimization and Operations Research
- Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

These skills strongly reinforce and refine the ability to make data-driven decisions.

I am interested in:
- Inference, Machine Learning, AutoML, Reinforcement Learning, Continual Learning, and Recommendation Systems
- Big data, data processing systems, and streaming data processing
- Operations research and logistics
- High performance computing and/or Cryptography (likely able to adapt fast)

Hopefully opportunities will come and I will be able to grasp it. But for now, I am a devoted student and welcome to connect to schoolmates and enthusiasts of Vietnam or any institutes around the world. I will publish my study materials for general IT courses and self-learning on GitHub monthly for now, bonus some source code for onschool projects.

I am also a man of culture, a cat lover and a theater kid. My bias is _Aki Hayasaki_ from **Chainsaw Man**. Hopefully my life will not become as tragic -_-.
